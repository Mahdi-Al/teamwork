<h1>About Films & Serials</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p> A serial film, film serial (or just serial), movie serial, or chapter play, is a motion picture form popular during the first
    <mark> half of the 20th century,</mark> consisting of a series of short subjects exhibited in consecutive order at one theater, generally
      advancing weekly, until the series is completed. Usually, each serial involves a single set of characters, protagonistic
       and antagonistic, involved in a single story, which has been edited into chapters after the fashion of serial fiction and
        the episodes cannot be shown out of order or as a single or a random collection of short 
    Each chapter was screened at a movie theater for one week.<br> and ended with a cliffhanger, in which characters found themselves
     in perilous situations with little apparent chance of escape. Viewers had to return each week to see the cliffhangers
      resolved and to follow the continuing story. Movie serials were especially popular with children, and for many youths
       in the first half of the 20th century a typical Saturday matinee at the movies included at least one chapter of a serial,
        along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.<br>
    There were films covering many genres, including crime fiction, espionage, comic book or comic strip characters, 
    science fiction, and jungle adventures. Many serials were Westerns, since those were the least expensive to film.
     Although most serials were filmed economically, some were made at significant expense.
      The Flash Gordon serial and its sequels, for instance, were major productions in their times.
       Serials were action-packed stories that usually involved a hero (or heroes) battling 
       an evil villain and rescuing a damsel in distress
        The villain would continually place the hero into inescapable deathtraps, or the heroine would be placed into a deathtrap
         and the hero would come to her rescue. The hero and heroine would face one trap after another, battling countless thugs
          and lackeys, before finally defeating the villain.<br>
          <b>The first film serial, What Happened to Mary?, was released in the United States by Edison Studios in 1912.
             At this time most films were short subjects, usually only two film reels in length (approximately 20 minutes).</b>
